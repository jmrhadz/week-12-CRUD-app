# week-12-crud project
 #### The Assignment:  
* Create a full CRUD application of your choice using either an API or local Array.
* Use an existing API with AJAX to interact with it. 
   * If you do not use an API, store the entities you will create, read, update, and delete in an array.
* Use a form to post new entities.
* Build a way for users to update or delete entities
* Use Bootstrap and CSS to style your project.

TODO: Currently I'm working on adding a search function that searches and imports recipes from themealDB.
   * If you search by ingredient or recipe name, it returns up to five results and lets you select one and add the day of the week and the meal of the day.
   * Otherwise, you can get a random recipe by ingredient or a random recipe, in case you don't know what to make that week.
